# VideoPoker
Coding project P7.10 in the 7th Edition of Big Java, with modifications

Instead of your player betting a single token each time, allow the player to bet between 1-5 tokens. If a player bets n tokens they win n times as much as indicated in the textbook prompt.

Your program must use the included templates. These templates are for the classes: Card, Deck, Game, Player, and a test class, TestPoker. You will need to fill-in the existing methods and may want to add more methods and/or instance variables to any or all of these classes except for the test class TestPoker. TestPoker must remain exactly as it is here.

This project requires you to have two versions of your game each constructed using a different version of the Game constructor. One will require an explicit parameter that you will get as a command-line argument, this is to help you (and us) test your code. That is, it will allow the user to specify the hand that the player gets which will help in testing if your game correctly identifies the various hands. Carefully read the comments in the template files to help you understand how this will work.
